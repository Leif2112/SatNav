# SatNav

This report is written in support of the MATLAB code devel-
oped for satellite orbital mechanics. In essence, this report
should lead the reader through the implications of the two-
body problem, demonstrate how they affect a satellite’s motion
in space, and provide clear derivation of the underlying phys-
ics. It should also discuss the various methods used to
determine and predict a satellite’s orientation in space, consid-
ering a torque-free context, all the while studying their relative
merits. Ultimately, the objective of this paper is to explore the
fundamentals of space dynamics, specifically, the principles of
orbital and attitude mechanics. These hold great significance
to spacecraft deployment and navigation in space.
